            <p>This blog post will go into character changes made by blizzard towards Mercy, a healer, and how that will affect the meta game.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>MERCY</h2>
            <p>Our once favorite and all powerful healer is receiving yet another nerf to her in game kit. Blizzard is on a mission to make the support meta more well rounded. As it stands, Mercy is a near 100% player pick game in, and game out. The goal with the new rework is to make other support champions like Symmetra or Zenyatta an actually viable choice for support.</p>
            <h3>Affect on the Meta</h3>
            <p>The most notable change players will see to Mercy's kit, is that her heal is now no longer instant. Blizzard has given Mercy's ressurection a 2 second casting delay. The aim of this change to Mercy's kit is to make other healers like Ana and now Moira more relevant to todays Meta game.</p>
            <p>With the release of Moira, players now have yet another champion to choose from when it comes to healing. I think that Blizzards new champion for Overwatch needed to be a viable pick, and with Mercy dominating gameplay, that wasn't likely to happen. Unfortunately, the 2 second delay to Mercy's Ressurection was to large of a nerf, and has made her all but useless except for her base healing abilities.</p>
            <h3>Potential for Improvement</h3>
            <p>While Mercy's nerf has affected some players more adversely than others, Blizzard is keeping an eye on the impact the Mercy nerf is having the meta game. If player picks of Mercy drop below a certain threshhold, it will be inevitable that Blizzard will consider tweaking her kit to entice players to pick her. This is what they may consider doing.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Decreasing cast time to 1 second or 1.5 seconds respectively</li>
              <li>Increase her gun damage, while reducing fire rate</li>
              <li>Make her heal consistenly multi-heal, but remove her Resurrection ability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many players have expressed disappointment with these options and instead have offered up their own ideas on how to improve the meta to make other healers/support champions more viable.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Give Zenyatta more life.</li>
              <li>Increase the range of Symmetra's attack.</li>
              <li>Increase Mercy's heal rate, while reducing damage.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With all these options, Blizzard certainly has a lot to consider, especially if they want their game to remain as one of the most played games of this decade.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 20th, 2017 by <a href="#">Daniel</a></p>

            <p>We are seeing a drastic shakeup in the state of politics today. From <a href="#">sexual misconduct</a>, of Roy Moore, to the extremely controversial repeal of net neutrality laws, the values our nation once stood for, are being sold to the highest bidder.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The <strong>Koch Brothers</strong> spend billions of dollars a year buying politicians and extracting promises in exchange for campaign contributions. Our democracy has now become an Oligarchy, where the rule of law is set by the rich and powerful.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Until <em>the people</em> revolt, and take back our country from corrupt politicians, and the top 1%, our nation is doomed to experience a great fall, such as what happened to the Ancient Romans.</p>

            <p>There is a great hiring spree by America's top Tech companies today. The problem: a lack of a qualifed labor force. With the great surge in demand for qualified software developers, Coding bootcamps are springing up around the country. The present a unique opportunity.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Training is much quicker, and more relevant to todays job market needs.</li>
              <li>GI Bill approved.</li>
              <li>High pay right out the gate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More and more young adults are foregoing the traditional path of going to University, and are instead choosing the route of Coding Bootcamps. These bootcamps are not for the faint of heart. The information is quite technical, and it is delivered at a faster pace than most high school graduates may be able to handle. That said, a dedicated and motivated individual could do well in this type of environment.</p>
